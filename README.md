# ‚öõÔ∏è Synthetic Physics Data Generator using PHI-2 + Sentence Transformers

This Python script generates **simple, student-friendly explanations** of various physics concepts using a powerful language model (`phi-2`) and filters them using sentence embeddings to ensure **uniqueness and quality**. It‚Äôs perfect for educators, content creators, and researchers looking to build datasets or educational material.

---

## üì¶ Features

- **Text Generation with PHI-2**: Uses Microsoft's `phi-2` model to generate natural, easy-to-understand explanations.
- **Semantic Deduplication**: Uses `MiniLM` sentence embeddings to remove semantically similar outputs.
- **Batch Generation**: Creates up to `1000` explanations with random topics for variety.
- **Clean Output**: Saves all unique explanations in JSONL format for easy downstream use.

## üß™ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch transformers sentence-transformers tqdm
```

> For CUDA/GPU support, ensure PyTorch is installed with CUDA version compatible with your system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Script**

2. **Run the script** using:

```bash
python synthetic_physics_generator.py
```

This will:

- Load the `phi-2` model and tokenizer
- Generate 1000 physics concept explanations (you can customize this)
- Deduplicate them using cosine similarity between sentence embeddings
- Save the results in a file named: `synthetic_physics_data.jsonl`

---

## üìù Output Format

Each line in the output file is a JSON object:

```json
{"text": "Matter exists in three main states: solid, liquid, and gas. ..."}
```

You can load this in Python as follows:

```python
import json

with open("synthetic_physics_data.jsonl", "r") as f:
    data = [json.loads(line) for line in f]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Recommendations

- This script is **resource-intensive**. Running it on CPU may be slow.
- Make sure to run in a virtual environment or Docker to avoid version conflicts.
- PHI-2 is for **research** use only; verify licensing before using in production.
